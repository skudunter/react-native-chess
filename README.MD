# react-native-chess

This app was built as a test of my skill to learn react-native and firebase.  
The app features login and register pages powered by firebase with a leaderboard page and a gameplay page.

## What I learnt

- typescript
- firebase storage
- firebase auth
- expo development

## Usage

```
npm i
npm start
```

## Notes

You will need to add a secrets.ts file in the src directory.  
You should add your firebase config to this file.

`secrets.ts`

```
export const API_KEY;
export const AUTH_DOMAIN;
export const DATABASE_URL;
export const PROJECT_ID;
export const STORAGE_BUCKET;
export const MESSAGING_SENDER_ID;
export const APP_ID;
export const MEASUREMENT_ID;
```
